**Project Overview:**

This Power BI dashboard was developed for a marketing company to track their key performance indicators (KPIs) across various time periods, including year, month, and week. The dashboard provides real-time insights into campaign performance, helping the company to make data-driven decisions and optimize their marketing strategies.

The dashboard tracks a range of metrics, including Sends, Responses, Sales, Response Rate (RR%), Debt Total, Debt per Deal, Cost, Profit, Cost per Acquisition (CPA), and Conversion Rate (CVR%). Additionally, Month-over-Month (MoM) and Week-over-Week (WoW) percentage change measures were implemented to highlight trends over time.
